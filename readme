C programs to demonstrate TCP sockets programming. Connects a client to a server on a specific port by sockets.

Client and server codes should be compiled and then run on separate terminals. 

A default port is defined, but user can use another port as well. 

The server can be started as follows:
./server -p <port-number>
<port-number> is user-defined port.

Client can be run as follows:
./client -h <hostname> -p <port-number>

Port number should be same for both client and server.
